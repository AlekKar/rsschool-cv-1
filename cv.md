3. I want to change my current engineer profession, because i got really dissapointed with it. I started my it journey 3 month ago and my main goal is to become a clever, cool developer and an independent man. I have a good work ethic, keep my body and mind in a good shape. I want to change my personality, learning and practising new things every day and i don't want to stop)
4. I can make simple landing pages with HTML/CSS, using grid, flexbox. Working with preprocessors like SASS and SCSS, can make some interactive tools on my site, like slider or pop-up menu). Started learning JS only two weeks ago. I want to understand the basics first and practise js code style.  
5. only css code, just add some styles to my portfolio cite:
    &__item {
        position: relative;
        &:before {
            content: '';
            height: 1px;
            width: 45px;
            position: absolute;
            top: 50px;
            background-color: #000;
        }
        &-head {
            padding: 30px 0 0 100px;
            h4 {
                margin-bottom: 0;
            }
        }
        &-icon {
            position: absolute; 
            top: 33px;
            left: 45px;
            @include before_circle;    
            img {
                position: absolute;
                left: 17px;
                top: 13px;
