            2. telegram: @travu; phone: +375(29)2934196<br><br>
            3. I want to change my current engineer profession, because i got really dissapointed with it. I started my it journey 3 month ago and my main goal is to become a clever, cool developer and an independent man. I have a good work ethic, keep my body and mind in a good shape. I want to change my personality, learning and practising new things every day and i don't want to stop)<br><br>
            4. I can make simple landing pages with HTML/CSS, using grid, flexbox. Working with preprocessors like SASS and SCSS, can make some interactive tools on my site, like slider or pop-up menu). Started learning JS only two weeks ago. I want to understand the basics first and practise js code style.<br><br>
            5. only css code, just add some styles to my portfolio cite:<br>
